## The relationship between the avatar and windmetaverse

Using the Avatar created by Nvwa, is the only viable way to participate in the Wind metaverse. Your identity in the metaverse is completely independent of the physical world. To have an avatar is akin to controlling a part of the consciousness of a soul.

## The background setting of the avatar
When you come to the Central Plains, you still have no right to determine the inherent history/data of your incarnation in the Central Plains world. The age, blood, and even names of all the incarnations of Genesis of windmetaverse have been determined by oracle. However, it is interesting that the same is true of human civilization in our physical universe. Infants have no power to choose. Every human being is like an incarnation, and the will/soul enters the incarnation of the physical world without the power of choice. For those who participated in the creation of the Fengyuan Universe, the greatest freedom is nothing more than finding a favorite avatar in a pseudo-random way to participate in the avatar's metaverse.

## Propagation of Avatars
[legacy-system] (legacy-system) in windmataverse is a system that has learned the monogamy and female physiological reproduction of modern human society. However, the DNA metadata of the new incarnation baby is determined based on the free will/metadata of the parents. The dominant bloodline of the offspring will be determined according to the bloodline of the wife, and the child's name will be determined by the free will/metadata of the incarnation, so as to preserve the particularity of this metaverse and the distance of the physical society to the greatest extent. At the same time, when the avatar is under the age of 18, the avatar's data will only exist on the oracle of the wind in the metaverse, and will not become a controllable chain asset. After the incarnation is 18 years old, their souls can be uploaded to the Wind Spirit Palace by their parents to find the soul of the incarnation.
